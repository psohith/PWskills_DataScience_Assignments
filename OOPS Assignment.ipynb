    "* In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the data and behavior that all objects of that type share. An object is an instance of a class. It has its own unique data and behavior, which is determined by the class from which it was created.\n",

    "A good example of a class is a Car class. This class would define the data and behavior that all cars share, such as the car's make, model, year, color, and speed. An object would be a specific car, such as a 2023 Toyota Camry. This car would have its own unique data, such as its license plate number and VIN number, and its own unique behavior, such as its current speed and fuel level."

    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer : **\n",
    "\n",
    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Encapsulation`: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called an object. It involves hiding the internal details of an object and providing a public interface through which other objects can interact with it. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and information hiding, which improves code organization, reusability, and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Inheritance` : Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It enables code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. The class that is inherited from is called the base class or superclass, and the class that inherits is called the derived class or subclass. Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Polymorphism` : Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method or function to have different behaviors based on the object type. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding (providing a different implementation of a method in a derived class) and method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). Polymorphism enhances flexibility, modularity, and code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Abstraction` : Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable units. It involves capturing essential features and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction provides a high-level view of an object or system, focusing on the relevant characteristics and interactions. It allows developers to create abstract classes and interfaces that define contracts and common behaviors without specifying the implementation details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, promoting modularity, and facilitating code maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These pillars of OOP provide principles and concepts that support the design and development of modular, reusable, and maintainable software systems. They encourage code organization, encapsulation of data and behavior, code reuse, flexibility, and modularity.\n",

    "* Invoking other methods: self allows you to invoke other methods of the class within its own methods. This enables interaction between different methods of the object and facilitates code organization.\n",
